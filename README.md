A small Javascript library for quickly manipulating and converting colors.

Example
-------

Spectra can be wrapped around many different types of objects to create a Spectra color that can be manipulated.

```javascript
var color = Spectra({r: 255, g: 25, b: 75});
color.red() // 255
```

Motivation
----------

The project was created to have a highly functional and lightweight way to deal with colors using Javascript, without any dependencies.

### Bower

The bower package is at `spectrajs`.
